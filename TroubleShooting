MongoDB – Failed to unlink socket file /tmp/mongodb-27017

Check the /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock permission, owner is root?

$ ls -ls /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock
0 srwx------ 1 root root 0 Aug 24 03:56 /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock

<h>Solution</h>
To fix it, delete the /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock file manually and start the mongod process. Check the /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock permission again, the ownership is changed to the ‘mongodb’ user.

$ sudo rm -rf /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock
$ sudo service mongod start
[ok]

$ ls -lsah /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock
0 srwx------ 1 mongodb mongodb 0 Aug 24 04:01 /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock

Common error
While sudo apt-get upgrade, Debian helps to upgrade the MongoDB automatically, and changed the mongodb-27017.sock ownership to root, and normally we start the ‘mongod’ process with user ‘mongodb’, and caused this “Operation not permitted”.
